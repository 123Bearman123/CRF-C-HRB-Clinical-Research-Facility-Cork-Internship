As part of my internship with the CRF-C, one of my tasks was to disseminate findings of clinical trial methodological projects to ensure easy to read and understandable patient facing documents. To complete this io firstly had to choose to the most appropriate software to creat the infographic of my liking. Once this was complete, I created a basic infographic as a platform to work with. After this, it was constant emails back and fourth to perfect the infographic. Even the smallest of details did not go unseen.
